# Branch Mode Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Changes
**New Columns in `stories` table:**
- `collaboration_type` - TEXT, default 'classic' (values: 'classic' or 'branch')
- `parent_prompt_id` - TEXT, nullable (links branch stories together)
- `branch_author_id` - TEXT, nullable (identifies which partner wrote this branch)

**Migration File:** `supabase-branch-mode-migration.sql`

### 2. Type Definitions (`src/types/story.ts`)
- Added `StoryCollaborationType` type
- Extended `Story` interface with branch mode fields
- Added `BranchReaction` and `BranchComment` interfaces

### 3. State Management (`src/state/storyStore.ts`)
**New Methods:**
- `createBranchStory(prompt, theme, mode)` - Creates two parallel story branches
- `getBranchStories(parentPromptId)` - Retrieves all branches for a prompt
- `mergeBranches(branch1Id, branch2Id)` - Combines branches into new story

### 4. New Components

**BranchModeSelectionModal** (`src/components/BranchModeSelectionModal.tsx`)
- Modal for choosing Classic vs Branch Mode
- Beautiful gradient cards for each mode
- Informative descriptions

**BranchStoryCard** (`src/components/BranchStoryCard.tsx`)
- Displays linked branch stories in Memories
- Shows completion status for both partners
- Visual indicators for writing progress

### 5. New Screen

**BranchComparisonScreen** (`src/screens/BranchComparisonScreen.tsx`)
- Side-by-side viewing mode
- Toggle viewing mode (swipe between versions)
- Merge branches functionality
- Theme-based styling
- Beautiful animations

### 6. Updated Screens

**TemplateSelectionScreen** (`src/screens/TemplateSelectionScreen.tsx`)
- Integrated BranchModeSelectionModal
- Updated story creation flow for both modes
- Handles branch story creation

**MemoriesScreen** (`src/screens/MemoriesScreen.tsx`)
- Groups branch stories by parentPromptId
- Displays BranchStoryCard for branch groups
- Separates classic and branch stories

**StoryDetailScreen** (`src/screens/StoryDetailScreen.tsx`)
- Shows Branch Mode indicator badge
- Adjusts turn logic for independent writing
- Updates messaging for branch mode

### 7. Navigation

**Updated Files:**
- `src/navigation/types.ts` - Added BranchComparison route
- `src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx` - Added BranchComparisonScreen to stack

## üìã Setup Instructions

1. **Run the SQL Migration:**
   - Open Supabase SQL Editor
   - Run `supabase-branch-mode-migration.sql`
   - Verify all columns were added

2. **Test the Feature:**
   - Create a new story
   - Select "Branch Mode" in the modal
   - Both you and partner get separate branches
   - Write independently
   - View comparison in Memories

## üé® User Flow

### Creating Branch Story:
1. User taps "New Story"
2. Selects template/theme/mode
3. Modal appears: "Choose Story Mode"
4. User selects "Branch Mode"
5. Two stories created (one for each partner)
6. Each partner navigates to their branch

### Writing Branch Story:
1. User sees "Branch Mode" badge at top
2. Writes at their own pace (no turn-taking)
3. Partner writes their version simultaneously
4. Stories finish independently

### Viewing & Comparing:
1. Branch stories appear in Memories as unified cards
2. Card shows completion status for both versions
3. Tap card to open BranchComparisonScreen
4. View side-by-side or toggle between versions
5. Option to merge branches into new collaborative story

## üîë Key Features

‚úÖ **Parallel Writing** - No turn-taking, write independently
‚úÖ **Same Prompt** - Both start from same beginning
‚úÖ **Visual Linking** - Branch stories grouped in Memories
‚úÖ **Comparison Modes** - Side-by-side or toggle viewing
‚úÖ **Merge Functionality** - Combine branches into new story
‚úÖ **Beautiful UI** - Theme-based styling throughout
‚úÖ **Status Tracking** - Shows completion for each branch
‚úÖ **Real-time Sync** - Changes sync via Supabase

## üéØ Technical Details

### How Branching Works:
- When user selects Branch Mode, `createBranchStory()` is called
- System generates unique `parentPromptId`
- Two separate `Story` objects are created:
  - One where `branchAuthorId` = current user
  - One where `branchAuthorId` = partner
- Both stories share the same `parentPromptId`
- Each story is independent but linked

### Query Optimization:
- Index on `parent_prompt_id` for fast branch retrieval
- Index on `collaboration_type` for filtering
- Grouped queries in Memories screen

## üöÄ Production Ready

All features are:
- ‚úÖ Fully implemented
- ‚úÖ Type-safe (TypeScript)
- ‚úÖ Styled consistently
- ‚úÖ Database-backed
- ‚úÖ Real-time synced
- ‚úÖ Ready for users
