# 🎉 WordChain App - Production Ready!

## ✅ All Improvements Completed

### 1. **Couple Connection Enhanced** ✓
**Fixed Settings screen partner management**
- Shows connection status when partner is already connected
- Added "Connect with New Person" button for existing connections
- Cleaner UI showing current partner connection state
- Users can now easily switch between writing with partner or someone new

**Location**: `src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx:139-198`

---

### 2. **Premium Modal Fixed** ✓
**Fixed screen overflow and sizing issues**
- Added SafeAreaView for proper top spacing
- Reduced padding and font sizes for better fit
- Uses contentContainerStyle for proper ScrollView padding
- All content now fits perfectly on screen without cutting off
- Better spacing and more compact design

**Location**: `src/components/PaywallModal.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Hero text: 3xl → 2xl font
- Hero description: lg → base font
- Feature items: Smaller spacing (mb-4 → mb-3)
- Pricing cards: More compact with better text sizing
- Content padding optimized for all screen sizes

---

### 3. **Template Prompts as Starting Words** ✓
**Stories now start with template text**
- When selecting a template, first 5 words are automatically added
- Users can immediately continue the story
- Creates better story flow and context
- No more blank stories - every story starts with inspiration!

**Location**: `src/state/storyStore.ts:135-149`

**How it works:**
```typescript
// Takes prompt like "Our first date was unforgettable because..."
// Splits into words: ["Our", "first", "date", "was", "unforgettable"]
// Adds first 5 words automatically to start the story
```

### 4. **Session Code Hidden in Memories** ✓
**Share codes only show when needed**
- Session code no longer appears on finished stories
- Only displays when:
  - Story is NOT finished
  - No partner has joined yet
- Cleaner memories view
- Better user experience

**Location**: `src/screens/StoryDetailScreen.tsx:300-313`

---

### 5. **Push Notifications Added** ✓
**Real-time turn notifications**
- Notifications when it's your turn to write
- Automatic registration on app start

- ✅ Integrated with story turn system

**Integration**: `src/state/storyStore.ts:212-221`

**How it works:**
