## üõ† Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration (REQUIRED!)

**IMPORTANT:** The app requires database columns for Branch Mode and session codes to work.

#### Single Migration (Recommended - All-in-One)
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/sql
2. Copy and paste the **entire SQL** from `supabase-complete-branch-migration.sql`
3. Click "Run"
4. Verify success by checking the output

This migration adds:
- ‚úÖ `session_code` column (6-digit codes for joining)
- ‚úÖ `collaboration_type` column (classic or branch)
- ‚úÖ `parent_prompt_id` column (links branch stories)
- ‚úÖ `branch_author_id` column (identifies branch author)
- ‚úÖ Indexes for better query performance
- ‚úÖ Constraints for data validation

**Migration is safe to run multiple times** - it uses `IF NOT EXISTS` checks.

#### Fixing Missing Session Codes (If Stories Cannot Be Joined)

If you created stories before running the migration, they may not have session codes. To fix this:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/sql
2. Copy and paste the **entire SQL** from `fix-missing-session-codes.sql`
3. Click "Run"
4. This will generate unique 6-digit codes for all existing stories

**Symptoms that indicate you need this fix:**
- Error message: "Story not found. The story you're trying to join may have been created before session codes were added."
- Cannot join branch mode stories even with the correct code
- Debug info shows "Available codes: []"

#### Alternative: Run Migrations Separately (Advanced)
If you prefer to run migrations in steps:
1. First run `supabase-migration-simple.sql` (base migration)
2. Then run `supabase-branch-mode-migration.sql` (Branch Mode specific)

**Note:** The single migration above includes everything you need!

### 2. RevenueCat Setup (Required for Premium)

**To enable real in-app purchases:**

1. **Create RevenueCat Account**
   - Sign up at https://www.revenuecat.com
   - Create a new project

2. **Configure App Store Connect**
   - Create your app in App Store Connect
   - Set up in-app purchase products (e.g., monthly, annual subscriptions)

3. **Connect RevenueCat to App Store**
   - In RevenueCat dashboard, add your iOS app
   - Connect to App Store Connect using API key
   - Configure your products and entitlements

4. **Add API Key**
   - Copy your RevenueCat public API key
   - Add to `.env` file:
