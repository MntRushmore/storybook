## 🐙 Push to Your Own GitHub

To push this to your personal GitHub repo, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository named "wordchain-app" (or any name you like)
3. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
4. Copy the repository URL (looks like: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wordchain-app.git`)

### Step 2: Add GitHub as a Remote
Run these commands in your terminal or tell me your GitHub username and I'll do it:

```bash
# Add GitHub as a new remote called "github"
git remote add github https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wordchain-app.git

# Push to GitHub
git push github main
```

**OR** tell me your GitHub username and I can run these commands for you!
